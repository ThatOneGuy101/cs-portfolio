    <h1>Today, I will teach you how to make an interactive mouse program. To make this, make sure you have a draw function, if and else conditions, fills, strokes and strokeWeights</h1>
<div>
    <h2>When you are finished with the coding, it should look like this:</h2>

<div id="div2">
<h5>
<pre>
<code>
    draw = function() {
    background();
    
    if (mouseX < 76) {
        ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 50);

<h3>First, the if statements</h3>
<img src="http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/JS/images/chapter_4/arguments_simplified.gif">
<h4>The if statements will go in the order from up to down. It will go through all of them until it finds a solution through one of the if statements. An example would be if x = 4 then output A, or else output B. That would be an example of an if/else statement.</h4>
<h3>Second, the fill function</h3>
<img src="https://learn.getgrav.org/user/pages/11.troubleshooting/01.page-not-found/error-404.png">
<h4>The fill function will color in anything under it. This can be used for making certain shapes a certain color to create such s masterpeice.</h4>
<h3>Third is the strokeWeight</h3>
<img src="https://d14nx13ylsx7x8.cloudfront.net/lesson_images/images/000/002/822/original/temp1424901172.png">
<h4>The strokeWeight increases the amount of width around the shape. You could call it the border or outline.</h4>
<h3>Last is the stroke</h3>
<img src="http://www.programmingbasics.org/en/downloads/html5canvas/img/htmlcanvas%20-%20078.png">
<h4>The stroke would be the color of the strokeWeight</h4>

<h3>After all of this coding, I am sure to remember about the if statements because it's the most important code within the program and because it's fun yo use. The If condition is usually used for making random solutions like choosing between option A or option B.</h3>
